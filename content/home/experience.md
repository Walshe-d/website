      description: 'Title: Integration of earth observation data to
improve long term forest management.

* Identified the spectral characteristics of healthy and nutrient deficient spruce plantations

* Carried out an area adjusted image classification using machine learning algorithms (random
forest) and multispectral satellite imagery (Sentinel 2)

* Carried out a national time series analysis of nutrient deficient spruce plantations using
multispectral satellite imagery (Landsat 5,7,8) and google earth engine

* Created an early warning system for nutrient deficient crops based on multispectral spectral
characteristics and age 

* Processed LiDAR data to create a DSM, DTM, and canopy height models

* Used field data, LiDAR data and machine learning algorithms (k-nn), to produce estimates
of forest parameters such as height, diameter, and volume

* Calculated the variance of these estimates at different areal scales to investigate how the size
of an area effects the variance

* Utilised multispectral satellite imagery (Sentinel 2) to determine both the area and severity for a national assessment of seasonal forest fires from 2017-2021'
