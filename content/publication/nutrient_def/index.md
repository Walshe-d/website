abstract: Nutrient deficiency in forest stands has a negative impact on timber production. Although there are numerous studies investigating nutrient deficiency in forests using remote sensing, research has usually focused on extracting nutrient/pigment concentrations using hyperspectral imagery. Results of studies using this method of assessment are uncertain at the canopy level. This study proposes using freely available multispectral imagery to identify nutrient deficiency in commercially managed forest plantations. A classification map of nutrient deficient, healthy, and a third class, other, for State spruce forests in the Republic of Ireland was constructed using multispectral Sentinel 2 images from Spring and a Random Forest model. The forest area of interest (AOI) was Sitka spruce or Norway spruce plantations greater than 12 years old. Results showed that the overall accuracy was 89% and the associated Kappa Index of agreement was 79%. An unbiased area estimator was vital for an accurate estimate of the scale of nutrient deficiency, which concluded that 23% of the AOI was nutrient deficient. Early detection of nutrient deficiency is crucial to mitigate negative impacts on productivity so a time series analysis of the spectral response of healthy and nutrient deficient classes using Google Earth Engine's Landsat 5, 7, and 8 archive was carried out. A control of known nutrient deficient sites, as identified through foliar analysis, was used for comparison with the nutrient deficient and healthy training data. The spectral response showed a decrease through time for all of the foliar analysis and training data using the green (520–600 nm), red (630–690 nm), and SWIR spectra (1550–1700 nm) during Spring. This decreasing trend is due to the growth of foliage, with the difference in spectral response between nutrient deficient and healthy stands being attributed to the presence of chlorosis in stands suffering from nutrient deficiency. Spectral thresholds using digital numbers for nutrient deficient stands were identified for an operational optimum age cohort of between 10–12 years old which will be used for early detection.
